Isaac's Vim config
==========

Basically, I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to to manage vim plugins and I recommend it for its simplicity.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository and put .vim to home:

        git clone git://github.com/gujiaxi/dotfiles
        cp dotfiles/.vim ~/.vim

2. Launch vim (just ignore the errors) and run:

        :PlugInstall
